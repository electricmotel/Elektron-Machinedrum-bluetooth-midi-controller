I will post latest code and schematics when I have time.  
Currently the unit uses several buttons connected to a XIAO analog in through a resistor ladder allowing multiple buttons with only one GPIO.  
The project is based around a Seeed Xiao EXP32C3 controller and a TFT screen using tft espi with a GC9A01 driver.  
A 7seg display shield from dfrobot, dfr0382, is used for its buttons and the 7seg display for mute/unmute status indication and because it looks cool.
